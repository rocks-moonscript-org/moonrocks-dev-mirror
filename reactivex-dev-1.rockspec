  summary = "Reactive Extensions for Lua (fork of RxLua)",
  detailed = [[
    Lua-ReactiveX gives Lua the power of Observables, which are data structures that represent a stream of values that arrive over time. They're very handy when dealing with events, streams of data, asynchronous requests, and concurrency.

    This is a friendly fork of RxLua. All credits for initial development go to the original author, bjornbytes (https://github.com/bjornbytes/RxLua).

    This fork includes some fixes and features contributed by the community. There are also foundational changes here in order to introduce a proper automatic unsubscription mechanism which was missing and caused unexpected behavior in some cases. These changes are heavily inspired by the RxJS internals, and thus RxJS is considered a reference implementation for all future development of Lua-ReactiveX.
