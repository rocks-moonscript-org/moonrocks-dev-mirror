      busted-flaky is a busted extension for handling flaky specs by retrying
      any block a specified number of times until it succeeds.

      It adds a new block that can wrap `describe` and `it` blocks. It also
      can be used by simply tagging any block with #flaky.

      The name of the block (flaky), tag (#flaky), the number of retries and
      the output on the specs can all be configured with -Xhelper options.
